# Showcase

An opt-in public gallery of real forged sites. Two jobs: proof that this
pipeline produces a genuinely different result each time, and a second,
internal check against `§3` — a place a future run can look and ask "has this
collision already been done here," on top of `peer-analyst`'s external search.

Nothing here is required. Every entry exists because a subject said yes.

---

## What gets shown

One entry per consenting run, in `showcase/<slug>/`:

- A screenshot of the live homepage, and one more of the section that best
  shows what makes the run distinct.
- **Archetype** — primary and shadow, from `BRAND.md`.
- **Style and collision** — the one-sentence answer from `DIRECTION.md`: which
  parent carried structure, which carried surface.
- **Palette** — the sampled hexes, per `§8`.
- **What was invented** — the `§3` line from `DIRECTION.md`, verbatim.
- **Live URL**, only if the subject wants it linked. Plenty of good entries are
  unlinked — visible as an example, not as traffic.

## What never gets shown

`EVIDENCE.md`. The interview record. `BRIEF.md` in full. Anything covered by
`§21`. The subject's real name, unless they explicitly want the attribution —
default to how they're described, not who they are: "a senior product
designer," not the name, mirrors exactly how `loops/03-copy.md` already
anonymizes NDA'd work. A showcase entry is a design sample, not a case study,
and it never needs more identifying detail than the design itself requires.

## Consent

Asked once, in Loop 8, right after the live screenshots exist — that is the
first moment a real asset for this actually exists to show them. One question:
would they like this run added to the public showcase in this repo.

Record the answer in `REPORT.md` either way. A no is not revisited, and it is
never asked again mid-run if declined once.

**A yes prepares the entry. It does not publish it.** The conductor writes the
files into `showcase/<slug>/` locally and tells the human where they are and
that opening a pull request against this repo is theirs to do, not something
that happens on their behalf. This repo is public and shared; nothing gets
added to it without a deliberate act by the person whose work it is.

## How a future run uses it

At Loop 2a, alongside `peer-analyst`'s external search, skim `showcase/` for
the same check `§3` already demands: if a prior entry shares this run's
archetype and style family, the collision has to differ, and the run says how
in `DIRECTION.md`. This is a floor, not a substitute for the external search —
the showcase only ever contains what this pipeline has produced, and the
obvious failure mode `§1` warns about is bigger than that.

## Removal

Same rule as `§19`'s attribution credit: the subject can ask for their entry
removed at any time. No argument, no "but it's such a good example." Remove
it and do not re-add it.
