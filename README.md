Turns a person into a deployed portfolio site. Interviewed, positioned, designed,
built, and live on infrastructure they chose.

It is an agent operating system: markdown instructions a capable coding agent
executes. There is nothing to install and no program to run.

## Why

The default portfolio is a template with someone's name in it. Same hero, same card
grid, same three-column skills section, same stock gradient. It says nothing about
the person, because nothing in it came from them.

This pipeline forces the opposite. The story comes out of an interview, not a
scrape. The look is derived from a brand strategy that can be defended, not from
taste. Every visual is generated rather than borrowed, every technique is proven in
a prototype before the design leans on it, and every claim traces to a source.

## The doctrine

| File | What it governs |
|---|---|
| [`PRINCIPLES.md`](./PRINCIPLES.md) | The binding rules. Five are hard and never skip |
| [`BRAND.md`](./BRAND.md) | Strategy: archetype, positioning, voice, the translation table |
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) | How many pages, how they route, and the blog |
| [`MODELS.md`](./MODELS.md) | Which model tier runs which step, and why the interview is not the cheap part |
| [`STYLES.md`](./STYLES.md) | What it looks like. 32 styles, and how to collide them |
| [`CRAFT.md`](./CRAFT.md) | How you render it. The technique arsenal |
| [`SKIPPING.md`](./SKIPPING.md) | What every step costs to leave out |
| [`PIPELINE.md`](./PIPELINE.md) | The map |

## The five that never skip

Everything else is optional. These are integrity, not quality:

- **Every claim traces to evidence.** A fabricated metric is a lie told on someone's
  behalf to people making a hiring decision.
- **Accessibility basics.** Skipping it locks real people out.
- **Deploy is reversible.** No snapshot, no deploy.
- **Gate C.** Nothing goes public under someone's name before they have seen it.
- **Identity safety.** Push and deploy as the subject, with their credentials.

## Multi-page and blogs

Decided at Gate A, because it changes the stack. A case study that deserves its own
URL is a citation someone can send; an anchor is not. And a blog means the subject
publishes without you, which hand-authored HTML cannot support — that is the one
thing that moves the default off plain HTML and onto a generator.

The run ends when they can publish on their own, not when the site is live.
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) covers the shapes, routing, and the handover.

## Deploy targets

Nine, including their own server as a first-class option: GitHub Pages, Netlify,
Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, VPS with nginx, VPS with Docker, cPanel, S3 with
CloudFront, and handoff. The target constrains the stack, never the reverse.

## Running it

See [`HOW_TO_RUN.md`](./HOW_TO_RUN.md). In short: point your agent at this repo,
give it the subject, and have it work the loops in order, stopping at each gate.

## Lineage

Sibling of [git-a-profile](https://github.com/PIIIX-org/git-a-profile), which does
the same thing for a GitHub README. Same shape, different problem: a README can be
built from an API, a portfolio cannot.
